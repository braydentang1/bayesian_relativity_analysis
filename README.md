# bayesian_relativity_analysis
A fully Bayesian way to determine premium relativities in insurance.

## Context
I am not an actuarial student (anymore) but I recently completed a typical
pricing assignment as part of an evaluation for a job application.
I didn't end up applying, however I enjoyed having a (fake) familiar kind
of dataset that I used to work with all the time in my past life.
